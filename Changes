Revision history for Perl extension Parse::Nmap::XML.

Changes for 0.63
	- added vendor to os_class
	- fixed division by zero on one of the efficiency test.
	- it now checks to make sure Time::HiRes is installed before
		performing tests.
	- minor warning problems removed on Win32 systems.

Changes for 0.62
	- stable release with all new changes.

Changes for 0.6_4
	- changes to parse filter tags. All previously called PARSE_* have
		the PARSE_ removed from them. Ex: PARSE_OSFAMILY is now
		OSFAMILY.
	- osclass tag added.
	- a bug found with the sequences is fixed
	- making use of ignore_elts to save when creating objects
	- parse_filters completly excludes tags that you decide not to parse.
		Much faster parsing and memory usage efficiency. efficiency.t
		tests this benchmark to make sure that the twig parser does not
		do any work it doesn't have to.
	- permanently excluding some static tags using ignore_elts.
	- added SCANINFO filter.

Changes for 0.6_3

		instead using 5.004
		fixed minor warnings when compiling with -w
		added 'use warnings' to _methods test

Changes for 0.6_1
	- fixed a bug with the test script (finding test file)
	- made a separate test to test the actual method existance
	- portability when running the tests using File::Spec.

Changed for 0.6
	- better memory management using twig_roots
	- some bugs with output types and filters
	- generic_os and all references are now refereed to as 'osfamily'
		I thought it better resembles what it stands for.
	- fixed some documentation problems
	- parse_filter_* have been replaced with parse_filters(), which
		can enable multiple different filters through a hashref.
		Filters available:
		ONLY_ACTIVE, PARSE_OSFAMILY, PARSE_UPTIME, PARSE_PORTINFO,
		PARSE_SEQUENCES
	- added parse information of
		tcpsequence, ipidsequence, tcptssequence
	- additions to Parse::Nmap::XML::Host methods
		tcpsequence, ipidsequence, tcptssequence

Changes for 0.5
	- faster loading module
	- added more documentation
	- minor speed improvements
	- added methods to Parse::Nmap::XML
		parse_filter_generic_os($bool) (see doc)
	- renamed only_active() to parse_filter_status($bool) (see doc)
	- Parse::Nmap::XML::Host
		changed hostnames() to take a value a number (see doc)
		changed os_matches() to take a value a number (see doc)

Changes for 0.4
	- added new package called ScanInfo (Parse::Nmap::XML::ScanInfo
        	this contains methods that make it easier to access the
        	scan information
	- added new package called Host (Parse::Nmap::XML::Host),
		which makes it easier to access values for each of the
		hosts found. See documentation.
		Host trees are now full of these *::Host objects.
