Parse/Nmap/XML version 0.6_1
============================

Parse Nmap xml-output files using perl

This module is intended to sift through the nmap scan outputs in xml form,
either by passing a filehandle that is being piped from a current nmap scan
or passing an xml filename that is the output of the of using the '-oX file.xml'
option. It uses the XML::Twig library, which is memory efficient and fast.
In the authors opinion, this module is very easy to use to extract information
from an nmap xml scan output about the scan itself and the hosts that were
scanned.

Because of the demand of this module, I'll be adding and changing some functions
and methods to make it easier to access the information. Also, more information
will be available as I keep working on this module. Send your feedbacks.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	XML::Twig 3.0+

In addition, you will need nmap 3.00+. You don't exactly need it, but this
version of nmap supports the xml output that this module can parse. So, you do
not really need the executable, but the xml output that you will be parsing
(or able to parse), must be from this version forward.

CHANGES

Changes for 0.6_1
	- fixed a bug with the test script (finding test file)
	- made a separate test to test the actual method existance
	- portability when running the tests using File::Spec.

Changes to 0.6
	- better memory management using twig_roots
	- some bugs with output types and filters
	- generic_os and all references are now refereed to as 'osfamily'
		I thought it better resembles what it stands for.
	- fixed some documentation problems
	- changes in Parse::Nmap::XML :
		parse_filter_* have been replaced with parse_filters(), which
		can enable multiple different filters through a hashref.
		Filters available:
		ONLY_ACTIVE, PARSE_OSFAMILY, PARSE_UPTIME, PARSE_PORTINFO,
		PARSE_SEQUENCES
	- added parse information of
		tcpsequence, ipidsequence, tcptssequence
	- additions to Parse::Nmap::XML::Host methods
		tcpsequence, ipidsequence, tcptssequence

Changes from 0.5
	- faster loading module
	- added more documentation
	- minor speed improvements
	- added methods to Parse::Nmap::XML
		parse_filter_generic_os($bool) (see doc)
	- renamed only_active() to parse_filter_status($bool) (see doc)
	- Parse::Nmap::XML::Host
		changed hostnames() to take a value a number (see doc)
		changed os_matches() to take a value a number (see doc)

FOR OTHER CHANGE INFORMATION SEE THE "CHANGES" FILE

TODO
	- have full support of all the scan information
	- make use of the ignoring of tags when parsing
	- add more from the nmap_std xml file
