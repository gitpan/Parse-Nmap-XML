Parse/Nmap/XML version 0.63
============================

frontend parser for nmap xml-output scan files

This module is intended to sift through the nmap scan outputs in xml form,
either by passing a filehandle that is being piped from a current nmap scan
or passing an xml filename that is the output of the of using the '-oX file.xml'
option. It uses the XML::Twig library, which is memory efficient and fast.
In the authors opinion, this module is very easy to use to extract information
from an nmap xml scan output about the scan itself and the hosts that were
scanned.

I am trying to balance efficiency with ease of use. If you think something
can be done differently send your feedback.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	XML::Twig 3.0+

In addition, you will need nmap 3.00+. You don't exactly need it, but this
version of nmap supports the xml output that this module can parse. So, you do
not really need the executable, but the xml output that you will be parsing
(or able to parse), must be from this version onward.

CHANGES


Changes from 0.60 to 0.63

	- added vendor to os_class
	- fixed division by zero on one of the efficiency test.
	- it now checks to make sure Time::HiRes is installed before
		performing tests.
	- minor warning problems removed on Win32 systems.
	- changes to parse filter tags. All previously called PARSE_* have
		the PARSE_ removed from them. Ex: PARSE_OSFAMILY is now
		OSFAMILY.
	- osclass tag added.
	- a bug found with the sequences is fixed
	- parse_filters completly excludes tags that you decide not to parse.
		Much faster parsing and memory usage efficiency. efficiency.t
		tests this benchmark to make sure that the twig parser does not
		do any work it doesn't have to.
	- permanently excluding some static tags using ignore_elts.
	- os_port_used, now can return the open or closed port used in OS
		detection depending on the given parameter.
	- CPAN Bug #2968:
		fixed bogus 'use 5.008' in Makefile.PL (runs on 5.6 also)
		instead using 5.004
		fixed minor warnings when compiling with -w
		added 'use warnings' to _methods test
	- fixed a bug with the test script (finding test file)
	- made a separate test to test the actual method existance
	- portability when running the tests using File::Spec.

FOR OTHER CHANGE INFORMATION SEE THE "CHANGES" FILE

TODO
	- make use of the ignoring of tags when parsing
	- use the twig conversion, to access values through a hash and not
		function calls. (Background).
	- add more from the nmap_std xml file (until new one is released)
